# Contributing

Contributions welcome!

This monorepo uses the AWS PDK, which is just a wrapper around projen. To get started, in the root, run `pnpm i` to install everything.

Then, you can handle things normally with projen, or you can use the PDK CLI instead, which is essentially the same thing. You can install globally or use `npx pdk` as per normal.
